# Privacy Policy — Parad0x Compress

**Effective date:** 2026-01-30  
**App:** Parad0x Compress  
**Developer:** Parad0x Labs  
**Contact:** [YOUR SUPPORT EMAIL]

This Privacy Policy explains how Parad0x Compress (“the app”) handles data. The app is designed to compress photos and videos primarily **on-device** and does not require user accounts.

---

## Summary (Plain English)
- **Your media stays on your device.** The app compresses selected photos/videos locally and does not upload your files to our servers by default.
- **Ads and purchases use Google services.** If you use the free/ad-supported version or buy Pro, Google’s services (AdMob and Google Play Billing) may collect certain device and usage data for ads, analytics, fraud prevention, and purchase processing.
- **You control what media you select.** The app only accesses media you choose to import/process.

---

## Data We Collect
### 1) Data you explicitly provide
- **Selected media files (photos/videos):** The app accesses only the files you select for compression.
  - **Processing location:** On-device.
  - **We do not receive or store your media on our servers** unless a future feature explicitly asks you to upload something (in that case, we will update this policy and provide in-app notice).

### 2) Data collected automatically (app-side)
Parad0x Compress itself does not require accounts and does not ask for your name, email, or contacts.

However, the app may process basic **diagnostic data** on-device (for example, to show compression progress or errors). If we add crash reporting/analytics in the future, we will update this policy and the Google Play “Data safety” disclosures.

---

## Third-Party Services (Ads & Billing)
Even if we don’t collect personal data directly, **third-party SDKs** we use may collect data.

### A) Advertising (Google AdMob / Google Mobile Ads SDK)
If the app shows ads (including rewarded ads), Google’s Mobile Ads SDK may automatically collect and share data such as:
- **IP address** (may be used to estimate general location)
- **Device and/or account identifiers** (including the Advertising ID where available)
- **User interaction data** (e.g., ad views, taps, app launches related to ads)
- **Diagnostic information** (e.g., performance and crash-related signals)
This data may be used for **advertising**, **analytics**, and **fraud prevention** by Google and its partners.  
(See Google’s Mobile Ads SDK disclosure details.)  

### B) In-app purchases (Google Play Billing)
If you purchase Pro or credits via Google Play Billing:
- Google processes the transaction (payment handling, refunds, fraud prevention).
- We may receive confirmation details such as purchase status, product ID, and timestamps needed to unlock features.
- We do **not** receive or store your full payment card details.

---

## How We Use Data
- **To provide the core app function:** compress and export your selected media locally.
- **To monetize the free version:** show ads (if enabled) and measure ad performance via AdMob.
- **To deliver Pro features:** validate purchases and unlock features after successful payment.
- **To improve reliability:** troubleshoot issues using diagnostic signals (typically provided by the OS and/or third-party SDKs).

---

## Data Sharing
We do not sell your personal data.

Data may be shared in these cases:
- **With Google services** used for ads and billing (AdMob, Google Play Billing), as described above.
- **For legal reasons** if required by law or to protect users, the public, or our rights.

---

## Data Retention
- **Your media files:** remain on your device. The app only works with the copies/URIs you select.
- **Ad and billing data:** retention is governed by Google and its partners’ policies.
- **Purchase verification records:** we keep only what is necessary to confirm entitlement to Pro features.

---

## Your Choices & Controls
- **Ads / personalization controls:** You can reset or delete your Android Advertising ID and manage ad personalization settings in your device settings (availability varies by Android version).
- **Permissions:** You can revoke media access permissions in Android system settings at any time. The app should continue to function, but you’ll need to re-select media to compress.
- **Delete exported files:** You can delete compressed exports using your file manager/gallery. (If the app includes an “auto-delete originals” option, it only affects files you choose and is executed on-device.)

---

## Children’s Privacy
Parad0x Compress is **not directed to children under 13**, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.  
If you believe a child has provided personal data, contact us and we will take appropriate steps.

---

## Security
We aim to protect your data by minimizing collection and keeping media processing on-device. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, but we design to reduce exposure.

---

## International Users
If you use the app outside the country where we operate, third-party services (like Google) may process data on servers located in other countries, according to their policies.

---

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy from time to time. We will update the “Effective date” above and publish the latest version at the same URL.
