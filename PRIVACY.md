# Privacy Policy

## Offline, privacy-first
Parad0x Compress does not use accounts and does not upload your media to any server. All compression happens on your device — your photos and videos never leave your phone.

## Data processing
- Media processing is performed locally on-device.
- We do not transmit your media files to us or to third parties.

## Local data storage
The app stores only:
- App settings (e.g., theme and compression preferences)
- Local Pro entitlement (a device-local license)
- Optional logs (debug builds only; release builds do not write logs to storage)

## What we do not collect
- No analytics
- No ads tracking
- No user behavior tracking

## Wallet interactions
- Wallet connection and transaction signing occur via your wallet app (e.g., Phantom / Solana Seeker).
- We do not receive, store, or access your private keys.
- The app may use the network to query the Solana blockchain (read-only) to verify payment status (e.g., wallet address, transaction signature, amount, and destination).
